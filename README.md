## Project requirements

Create React app compiled with Webpack that compares 2 characters' residences and declares if they ever lived/seen together, using the public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api/).

The criteria is as follows:

* If they have shared a planet, starship or vehicle before.
* If so, state the characters' names and movie(s) where that occurred (i.e. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were seen together in The Empire Strikes Back).
* The list can go as long as it needs to.
* Use 2 select boxes for the user to pick any character that is available from the API.
* Cool transitions.
